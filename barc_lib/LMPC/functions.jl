# Important information about oldTraj:
# ======================================
# oldTraj.oldTraj contains all state information of one lap. It is structured like follows:
# The first <prebuf> values are the end of one lap before the next lap starts (necessary for inter-lap-system-ID)
# The last value of <prebuf> ends with the last value *before* the finish line (s < s_target)
# The s-values within <prebuf> need to be below zero (-> before the finish line). Otherwise they can be mistaken as the end of the current (not previous) lap.
# After <prebuf> follow the recorded states of the trajectory (as many as there were during one lap)
# The number of recorded states during one trajectory (0 <= s < s_target) is equal to <oldCost>.
# After the recorded trajectory, the rest of the vector (until <buffersize>) is filled up with constant values
